                <p>Introduction</p>

                <p>Yash Jain & Associates, including all affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "YJ & Associates"), is committed to complying with applicable data privacy and security requirements in the countries in which it operates. YJ & Associates adheres to internationally recognized standards of privacy protection and complies with various global privacy laws, including but not limited to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This Privacy Notice applies when providing valuation advisory, corporate finance, restructuring, governance, risk, investigations, disputes, intelligence, diligence, compliance and regulatory consulting, cyber risk, or other services (the “services”) to its customers.</p>

                <p>Who is Collecting Data?</p>

                <p>Data will be collected by YJ & Associates (or its affiliates and subsidiaries, collectively "YJ & Associates"). This policy applies to personal data which is collected and/or used by YJ & Associates in its capacity as a data controller, as defined in the GDPR and similar privacy laws, for the purposes set out below under Processing of Personal Data.</p>

                <p>When YJ & Associates provides services to clients, we sometimes process personal data as a data processor, meaning that we process the data solely on the instructions of our clients, who determine the purpose and means of processing and exercise overall control of the data (e.g., the hosting of client data on our web-based due diligence portal). Therefore, if you have questions or wish to exercise your rights relating to your personal data, you may need to contact the client (and controller) on whose behalf the processing of your data is carried out. If we receive a request from you relating to data controlled by a client, we will pass the request to the appropriate client (and controller) where permitted by applicable privacy law.</p>
